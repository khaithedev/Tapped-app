# Tapped-app
Planning, Features, and Flowcharts for the Tapped app - a one-draw party challenge experience

🗓️ Day 1 – Concept Planning

🎯 App Name: Tapped

Tapped is a chaotic, high-stakes dare app that transforms boredom into content. The concept is simple:
One draw. No turning back.

The app gives users randomized dares, but with a twist — the more you play, the crazier it gets.
What starts as fun becomes unpredictable chaos.

⸻

🧩 Core Concept
    •    Draw a dare → complete it → get crazier dares as your streak grows.
    •    Users can record their reactions directly in the app and upload them to TikTok, YouTube Shorts, or Instagram Reels.
    •    Creator Mode lets bold users upload, edit, and share their own dares directly from the app.
    •    A 5-star voting system ranks user-submitted videos, creating a competitive, viral content loop.
    •    The top-rated creator each month wins a percentage of app revenue, encouraging consistent and creative participation.
